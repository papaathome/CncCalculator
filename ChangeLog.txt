Development path
================

Requirement status:
 * ? Requested, may move to a following release.
 * . Not yet implemented.
 * x Implemented but partial, untested or broken.
 * v Implemented and tested.

Version x.y.0.0, wishlist:
 * Add documentation.
 * Call for user responces.
 * Make FreeCAD tools library import v0.18 available at menu level.
 * Split off libScaledType and use at nuget package level.

Known problems not yet solved (and also not a problem for CncCalculator):
 1 Design flaw: Any scale "[x/x]" = "[x^0]" is reduced to "[#]" = "[#^1]", any "[#^n]" is reduced to "[#^1]"
   Any scale "[x^0]" is a valid "dimentionless constant of scale x" and should not reduce to a "constant with no scale"
   (not a problem for CncCalculator)
 2 Scanner stream input position not calculated correct in .NET 8 (not a problem for libScaledType).

Version: 0.3.0b not yet released.
 * v Moved libScaledType to .NET 8
 * v Moved CncCalculater to .NET 8, using WPF + Caliburn Micro, redesigned GUI.

 * v libScaledType using INumber<T> for values, can use any type that supports this interface.
 * v Added NUnit tests on CncCalculator classes
 * v Added Converter tag, moved calculations to 'Feeds and Speeds' tab
 * v Not using Log4Net, no need to log.
